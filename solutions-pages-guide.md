## Cross-Linking Process

When adding or updating content:

1. **Adding a New Solution**:
   - Check if any existing industry solutions use this solution
   - Add links to those industry solutions in the solution card
   - Update the relevant industry solutions to include links to this new solution

2. **Adding a New Industry Solution**:
   - For each implemented/recommended solution listed, add links to the Solutions page
   - For real case studies, use "Implemented at" language
   - For projected packages, use "Recommended for" language

## Content Type Distinction

### Real Case Study vs. Solution Package

**Real Case Study (Client-Based)**
- Badge/label clearly indicating "Client Success Story"
- Use "Implemented" and "Results" terminology
- Include specific metrics and testimonials
- Link directly to solutions that were actually used

**Solution Package (Industry-Based)**
- Badge/label indicating "Recommended Solution Package"
- Use "Projected" and "Estimated Impact" terminology
- Include industry-standard metrics as projections
- Link to solutions that are ideal for this industry

## Transition Strategy

As more clients are onboarded:

1. Add real case studies with "Client Success Story" badges
2. Gradually replace solution packages with real case studies
3. When sufficient real case studies exist (5+), rename from "Industry Solutions" to "Results" or "Case Studies"
4. Reorganize page to prioritize client success stories over solution packages
